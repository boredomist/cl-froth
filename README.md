# cl-froth
cl-froth is a port of the FORTH interpreter froth, written in Clojure
some time ago. The point of it is for me to become acquainted with
Common Lisp, so expect ugliness and bad practices ahead

# building
Uses ASDF and quicklisp. With SBCL, you can `(load "make")` or run
`./make.lisp`, with other Lisps, you're on your own.

# license
I don't know, how about Microsoft Public License?
